These are custom functions that I either created or modified the living snot out of to work for me. While I have zero desire to profit from the work of others,
it's worth noting that I'm publicly sharing my work and not being a pretentious prick about signing my name to every variable, and the burying every
actual function beneath a layer of BS with my name on it like some do.

Or worse: Burying my powershell code in an encrypted DLL because I treat money like the chinese treat garlic: Never enough. (It's a joke, not a dick. Try not to take it so hard)

If you find this useful, great. If not, sorry. Better luck next time, I guess. I'll work on getting better with every aspect of my life, while you waste yours
bitterly complaining about how my code sucks.
